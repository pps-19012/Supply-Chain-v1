## List of errors faced during project.
1. Truffle installation issue - Use nvm to download (in this case downgrade) node version. You can have multiple node versions installed and use nvm to switch between them accordingly.
2. Truffle unbox react issue - The latest versions of truffle-react box does not contain Migrations.sol. Use the template development folder present in GitHub account. Second solution: Use ```truffle init``` and then ```truffle unbox react``` to get migrations folder and truffle folder (SimpleStorage.sol).
3. Setting up Metamask with Truffle Develop - Set the localhost address in the ```truffle-config.js``` and the networkID/chainID as you like. Change the ```truffle-config.js``` or adjust accordingly. Afterwards, choose private key and create account. 
  > Eventhough the networkID is 5777 metamask wants it to be 1337. Why does it work? 
4. While making transaction with the localhosted website errors might occur due nonce and insufficient funds. To solve the nonce issue, close the terminal and start with ```truffle develop``` and ```migrate```. To solve the insufficient funds issue make sure that you are logged into correct account. Use the private key generated in truffle develop console to log in to the account.
